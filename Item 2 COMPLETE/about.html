  <h3>ABOUT NORTH FACE</h3>
  <h5 id="history">The North Face was founded in 1966 as a climbing equipment store in San Francisco.
   At first, only high-end specialist equipment was sold.
   Today, however, the brand offers a wide range of clothing including sportswear, camping equipment and winter coats.
  The North Face is named after the often perilous and coldest side of a climb, its north-facing side.</h5>
  <h3>SUSTAINABILITY</h3>
  <h5 id="sustainability">At North Face's Headquarters in California, 100% of the building's electricity is generated via renewable methods.
   Our Responsible Down Standard and Clothes the Loop apparel initiatives have led the way for sustainability in the industry.
  The Explore Fund is also paving a path for future generations by helping young people experience the great outdoors.</h5>
